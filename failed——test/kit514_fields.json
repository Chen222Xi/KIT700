Unit Description  https://outlines.utas.edu.au/2025/KIT/KIT514/Semester 2/KIT514_Semester 2.mhtml  2/10  \f2025/7/30 20:08  Unit Outline  This unit will introduce you to advanced principles and practice of developing secure web   deployments. It will focus on the implementation strategies and technology for deploying   scalable web applications. Web applications nowadays need to provide customised   experiences to the users to provide a consistent use experience and capabilities. The interface   must retain user attentions as much as possible. Web pages should be designed carefully, and   the interface may change dynamically according to user demands or trends. You will use a   cloud platform to create your own deployments of secure distributed web applications, load   balancing and server configurations. The web applications will be designed with suitable Web   Design Architecture in PHP or NodeJS and suitable database management, e.g., MySQL.  Intended Learning Outcomes  As per the Assessment and Results Policy 1.3, your results will reflect your achievement   against specified learning outcomes.   On completion of this unit, you will be able to:  1  2  3  4  Analyse security and performance issues in traditional and cloud-based  web applications  Develop webservices to implement cloud-based web applications  Evaluate and implement appropriate countermeasures and prevention  techniques to secure a web application  Design cloud-based web applications using the intelligent interface and  back-end aligned with business requirements  Requisites  REQUISITE TYPE  REQUISITES  Pre-requisite  KIT502  Alterations as a result of student feedback  Addition of GitHub.  Streamlined instructions for Virtual Machine interaction (including longer idle-detection   shutdown times).  Additional NodeJS content.  https://outlines.utas.edu.au/2025/KIT/KIT514/Semester 2/KIT514_Semester 2.mhtml  3/10  \f2025/7/30 20:08  Unit Outline  Teaching arrangements  ATTENDANCE  MODE  TEACHING  TYPE  LEARNING ACTIVITY  CONTACT  HOURS  FREQUENCY  On Campus  Lecture  (Online)  Tutorial  Online  Independent  Learning  2  Weekly  2  Weekly  2  Weekly  A real-time (i.e. synchronous)  interactive activity involving the  whole class whose primary  purpose is the presentation  and structuring of  information/ideas/skills to  facilitate student learning. All  students are expected to  attend.  A structured real-time (i.e.  synchronous) activity in a  small-group setting where the  primary purpose is the  clarification, exploration or  reinforcement of subject  content presented or accessed  at another time or place (e.g.  lecture, preparatory work). It is  reliant on student-teacher and  student-student interaction and  dialogue for achievement of its  learning outcomes. The  students enrolled in the tutorial  are expected to attend.  Involving reading, listening to  audio, watching video, and/or  completing exercises and/or  quizzes, self-study is individual  work undertaken when the  student chooses (i.e.  asynchronous), most likely  through engagement with  MyLO. The content is  examinable, and may need to  be completed prior to attending  classes and/or attempting  assessment tasks.  Attendance /",
  "Engagement Expectations": "engagement expectations  If your unit is offered On campus, it is expected that you will attend all on-campus and onsite   learning activities. This is to support your own learning and the development of a learning   community within the unit. If you are unable to attend regularly, please discuss the situation   with your course coordinator and/or our UConnect support team.  If your unit is offered Online or includes online activities, it is expected you will engage in all   those activities as indicated in the Unit Outline or MyLO, including any self-directed learning.  If you miss a learning activity for a legitimate reason (e.g., illness, carer responsibilities)   teaching staff will attempt to provide alternative activities (e.g., make up readings) where it is   possible.  https://outlines.utas.edu.au/2025/KIT/KIT514/Semester 2/KIT514_Semester 2.mhtml  4/10      \f2025/7/30 20:08  Unit Outline  How will I be Assessed?

Academic progress review  The results for this unit may be included in a review of your academic progress. For information   about progress reviews and what they mean for all students, see Academic Progress Review in   the Student Portal.  Submission of assignments  Where practicable, assignments should be submitted to an assignment submission folder in   MYLO. You must submit assignments by the due date or receive a penalty (unless an   extension of time has been approved by the Unit Coordinator). Students submitting any   assignment in hard copy, or because of a practicum finalisation, must attach a student cover   sheet and signed declaration for the submission to be accepted for marking.  Academic integrity  Academic integrity is about acting responsibly, honestly, ethically, and collegially when using,   producing, and communicating information with other students and staff members.   In written work, you must correctly reference the work of others to maintain academic integrity.   To find out the referencing style for this unit, see the assessment information in the MyLO site,   or contact your teaching staff. For more detail about Academic Integrity, see Important   Guidelines & Support.  Requests for extensions  If you are unable to submit an assessment task by the due date, you should apply for an   extension.  A request for an extension should first be discussed with your Unit Coordinator or teaching   support team where possible. A request for an extension must be submitted by the assessment   due date, except where you can provide evidence it was not possible to do so. Typically, an   application for an extension will be supported by documentary evidence: however, where it is   not possible for you to provide evidence please contact your Unit Coordinator.  The Unit Coordinator must notify you of the outcome of an extension request within 3 working   days of receiving the request.  Late penalties  Assignments submitted after the deadline will receive a late penalty of 5% of the original   available mark for each calendar day (or part day) that the assignment is late. Late   submissions will not be accepted more than 10 calendar days after the due date, or after   assignments have been returned to other students on a scheduled date, whichever occurs first.   Further information on Late Penalties can be found on the Assessments and Results   Procedure.  https://outlines.utas.edu.au/2025/KIT/KIT514/Semester 2/KIT514_Semester 2.mhtml  8/10      \f2025/7/30 20:08  Unit Outline  Review of results and appeals  You are entitled to ask for a review of the marking and grading of your assessment task if there   is an irregularity in the marking standards or an error in the process for determining the   outcome of an assessment. Details on how to request a review of a mark for an assignment are   outlined in the Review and Appeal of Academic Decisions Procedure.  https://outlines.utas.edu.au/2025/KIT/KIT514/Semester 2/KIT514_Semester 2.mhtml  9/10    \f2025/7/30 20:08  Unit Outline  https://outlines.utas.edu.au/2025/KIT/KIT514/Semester 2/KIT514_Semester 2.mhtml  10/10"
