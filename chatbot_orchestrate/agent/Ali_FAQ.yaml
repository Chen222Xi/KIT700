   This agent helps University of Tasmania (UTAS) students get quick, reliable answers to common administrative questions. It covers enrolment (how to enrol, change or withdraw; prerequisites; overloads; cross-institutional study), MyTimetable (planning, preferences, waitlists, clashes, connections, iCal sync, time-zone settings), exams (timetables, on-campus vs. online/Respondus, what to bring, special arrangements/LAP, alternative campuses, deferred/supplementary assessments), results (viewing results, result codes, sanctions), academic records (GPA meaning and calculation, academic transcripts, enrolment confirmation letters), study load & visas (reduced load on student visa, CoE extensions), key dates (census, fee due, withdrawal without fail, results release), and student services (UConnect, getting around campuses, shuttles/Metro).

  What it does
    Understands natural-language questions (e.g., “When are my exams?“, “Why can’t I register for classes?“, “How do I get my transcript?“)
    Maps queries to the correct policy/FAQ and returns clear, step-by-step guidance
    Highlights important conditions (deadlines, sanctions, prerequisites) and next actions
    Offers gentle escalation (Unit Coordinator, Student Adviser, UConnect) when needed

    Primary knowledge
    UTAS FAQs and student-facing guidance on enrolment, timetables, exams, results, records, study load/visa, and key dates

    Typical inputs
    Short student questions with optional context (study period, campus, on-campus/online)

    Typical outputs
    Concise answers with steps, definitions, and decision points
    Where helpful, directions to the correct UTAS system (eStudent, MyTimetable, Student Portal, MyLO) or contact channel (UConnect/Student Adviser)

    Example prompts it handles well
    “How do I register for classes and see my timetable?“
    “Why can’t I find my unit in MyTimetable?“
    “When will my exam timetable be available?“
    “What can I take into an exam?“
    “How do I view my results and what do the result codes mean?“
    “How is GPA calculated?“
    “How do I request an academic transcript or enrolment confirmation?“
    “Can I take a reduced study load on a student visa?“
    “My CoE is expiring—how do I extend it?“
    “What’s the census date and why does it matter?“

    Limitations & guardrails
    Provides general guidance only; does not access personal records or make enrolment changes
    Reminds users to check their current study period’s key dates and unit-specific instructions in MyLO
    Escalates to the appropriate UTAS contact when the question is case-specific or policy-sensitive

    Handoffs
    UConnect (general support, sanctions, manual withdrawals), Student Adviser (study plans/reduced load), Unit Coordinator (unit quotas/approvals), Exams team (clashes/deferred), Accessibility Adviser (LAP)
