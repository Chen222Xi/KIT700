Credit applications can take 2 - 4 weeks to assess, so make sure you apply well before the start of the study period. If your application is unsuccessful and you haven't enrolled in the unit/s, you risk missing the deadline to enrol. If credit is granted after you have commenced study (and before the census date for your study period) you will be automatically withdrawn from the unit/s without any academic or financial penalty. If your application for credit is late, or credit is granted after the census date for your study period, please contact UConnect for assistance. If I get credit, can I enrol in a different unit? New enrolment will depend on how far into the study period it is when your credit is approved. In most cases, you can withdraw and self-enrol in a different unit until Monday of week 3 for the main semesters, or the end of week 1 for other study periods.

app_answers_detail_a_id_2549_kw_enrol,Can I apply for a reduced study load while on a student visa?,"Yes, if compassionate or compelling circumstances prevent you from studying full time and your course permits it, you can apply for a reduced study load for a specific study period. If on a student visa, you must maintain satisfactory progress in your course (visa condition 8202) so you can complete it before the end of your CoE. To do this, you would normally enrol in a standard study load of at least 50 credit points in each main study period (or 100 - 150 credit points across a calendar year). To help you meet this requirement, the University monitors your progress and, in some circumstances, can approve a reduced study load. How to apply: The number of units you wish to enrol in for the study period A personal statement detailing the compassionate or compelling circumstances affecting your study Any relevant supporting documents, in English You do not need to request approval for a reduced study load if: The number of units you can enrol in has been restricted by the University You are in your final study period (and need fewer than 50 credit points to complete your course) You're on track to complete your degree by the end of your CoE but credit you've received leaves you with fewer than 50 credit points available to enrol in a study period. These are situations, usually unexpected, which are beyond your control and significantly affect your progress in your course or your wellbeing. Potential impact of a reduced study load: Taking a reduced study load will affect your study plan and, depending on your course it may affect when you can take units. For study plan advice, contact a Student Adviser through UConnect – email U. Connect@utas. edu. au or call 13 8827 (13 UTAS) / +61 3 6226 6200.

You can renew your membership directly with your OSHC provider, however it is valid for the length of your visa and will not be affected if you go home for the holiday periods. You might be able to suspend your OSHC if you take a Leave of Absence. Who is my provider? If you paid for your OSHC cover when you accepted your offer your policy will be with Medibank, the University's preferred provider, however you can choose which ever OSHC provider you like. You do not have to choose the University's preferred provider. When does my cover start? If you are a new student who arranged your Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) through the University, your cover will begin on the start date as stated on your Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE). If you arrive in Australia before or after this date, you will need to update the commencement date of your OSHC policy. When will I get my Medibank Policy Certificate (OSHC)? Medibank will email your Policy Certificate within five business days of your CoE (Confirmation of Enrolment ) being issued. If it has been longer than this and you haven't received it, contact utas. oshc@utas. edu. au. If you are travelling alone, you shouldn't need a copy of your OSHC Policy Certificate for your visa application.

If you are travelling with family members, email all full names, gender, and dates of birth to utas. oshc@utas. edu. au. How do I get my membership details?

app_answers_detail_a_id_1800_kw_enrol,How long does a bachelor degree take to complete?,"A bachelor degree usually takes three years of full-time study (8 units or 100 credit points per year) to complete. Some courses are fast-tracked to be completed in two years. Other courses require the completion of a fourth year of study in order to become qualified in that particular field, such as Education and Teaching, and Engineering. You can check the amount of time you have to complete any course under 'Duration' in your course's entry on the Courses and Units page: Please note that some courses do not allow part time study, for example the Bachelor of Medical Research, so if you are considering part time study, contact a Student Adviser for help with planning your enrolment. 'Minimum' - is the shortest time to complete the course if you are studying full time 'Maximum' - is how long you have to complete the course if you are studying part time time. If you are likely to exceed the maximum time to complete your course, you will need to contact UConnect to apply for an extension. If this is approved, the expected date of completion for your course will be adjusted. Your weekly time commitment will depend on the number of units you are enrolled in, and the different activities you will need to participate in for each unit (for example, lectures, tutorials, practicals, or workshops). In addition to this you need to allow time for reading, and assessment tasks. To manage your time effectively, you should allow around 10 hours of study time (including class time) for each 12. 5 credit unit per week. This means that a full-time study load is approximately the same time commitment as full-time work (between 30-40 hours a week).",app_answers_detail_a_id_1800_kw_enrol.html

app_answers_detail_a_id_2549,Can I apply for a reduced study load while on a student visa?,"Yes, if compassionate or compelling circumstances prevent you from studying full time and your course permits it, you can apply for a reduced study load for a specific study period. If on a student visa, you must maintain satisfactory progress in your course (visa condition 8202) so you can complete it before the end of your CoE. To do this, you would normally enrol in a standard study load of at least 50 credit points in each main study period (or 100 - 150 credit points across a calendar year). To help you meet this requirement, the University monitors your progress and, in some circumstances, can approve a reduced study load. How to apply: The number of units you wish to enrol in for the study period A personal statement detailing the compassionate or compelling circumstances affecting your study Any relevant supporting documents, in English You do not need to request approval for a reduced study load if: The number of units you can enrol in has been restricted by the University You are in your final study period (and need fewer than 50 credit points to complete your course) You're on track to complete your degree by the end of your CoE but credit you've received leaves you with fewer than 50 credit points available to enrol in a study period. These are situations, usually unexpected, which are beyond your control and significantly affect your progress in your course or your wellbeing. Potential impact of a reduced study load: Taking a reduced study load will affect your study plan and, depending on your course it may affect when you can take units. For study plan advice, contact a Student Adviser through UConnect – email U. Connect@utas. edu. au or call 13 8827 (13 UTAS) / +61 3 6226 6200.

app_answers_detail_a_id_1969,What is academic dishonesty and plagiarism?,"A common breach of academic integrity is when you don’t reference (or inaccurately reference) something written or produced by someone else. This is called plagiarism. The University recognises three types of plagiarism: unintentional plagiarism; dishonest plagiarism; and recycling previous work (also sometimes known as self-plagiarism). Plagiarism may occur when a student: copies another person’s work, in whole or in part, without a reference fails to use or inappropriately uses direct quotation marks fails to paraphrase or inappropriately paraphrases sections of text (e. g. , patchwork paraphrasing) uses exactly the same phrases, structure or organisation of ideas without direct quotation marks, appropriate paraphrasing or reference to sources (i. e. , inappropriate semantic match) presents another person’s designs, codes, sounds, images or ideas as their own work reproduces provided lecture notes, content or recordings without acknowledgement appropriates cultural artefacts without permission and/or appropriate acknowledgement uses online paraphrasing tools or other ‘cognitive offloading’ techniques copies any material (e. g. , text, code, images, designs, ideas), in whole or in part, from a file sharing site and submits it as their own in an assignment or other assessable work copies open or closed book quiz/test/invigilated exam answers or solutions from: a file sharing site; live discussion board/app; live subject-matter expert support site; or other live third parties in person or online. a file sharing site; live discussion board/app; live subject-matter expert support site; or other live third parties in person or online. a file sharing site; live discussion board/app; live subject-matter expert support site; or other live third parties in person or online. Plagiarised material may include, but is not limited to: text in published or unpublished works code images designs video audio ideas web page content spoken words physical artefacts lecture notes, content or recordings original terminology or phrases. What type of sources do I reference? The short answer is any ideas or material that you use in your assignments that are not your own. In academic writing, you must make a distinction between your ideas and those of others. This means the reader (your tutor or lecturer) needs to easily know when they are reading the author’s ideas (that’s you! ) and when they are reading the ideas of others (other authors/experts). In the body of the text that you write, you need to refer to (reference) any outside sources. This is called an ‘in-text reference’. An in-text reference usually includes the last name/s of the author/s and the year the source was published (e. g. , Smith & Brown 2022). Any idea or material that is not labelled by a reference is assumed to be yours. You do not need to reference any ideas that are common knowledge or ‘facts’ publicly known by everyone or a large number of people. For example, there are 365 days in a year. However, if you did not think of the ideas and words on your own, reference them! When the University identifies a suspected breach of academic integrity a report is sent to an Academic Integrity Adviser in your School or Institute, who will decide whether to proceed with a formal Letter of Concern. If proceeding, a letter will be sent to you outlining the details of the concern. You will be invited to attend a meeting and/or to make a written statement addressing the concern within 10 working days. After this, an outcome will be made (with or without your verbal or written statement) and a breach level will be assigned (i. e. no breach, low, intermediate, or high). You may also receive a potential sanction such as resubmission and/or reduced marks. You will be notified of the outcome in writing. Students have the right to appeal the outcome within 10 working days. To find out more visit the Academic Integrity student portal page.",app_answers_detail_a_id_1969.html

app_answers_detail_a_id_2579,Can I use generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) for my assessments?,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) tools should only be used to support your learning and assist with the completion of your assessments. The work that you submit must be yours only and must be prepared in accordance with the instructions for that assessment task. UTAS supports an approach whereby students are taught to appropriately use genAI software in an ethical and responsible way to prepare them for future professional work environments. Your Unit Coordinator might encourage the use of AI as a resource for some assessments; others might not allow it. Be sure to check your assessment instructions carefully (e. g. within MyLO or the assessment instructions in your unit outline) or confirm with your Unit Coordinator if unsure. Your Unit Coordinator may require you to acknowledge if/when/how a genAI tool was used. GenAI technologies can assist you with some approved activities, but they should never replace your ability to think and critically analyse information for yourself. Always take a thoughtful and considered approach to the use of genAI outputs. Unapproved, inappropriate, or unacknowledged use of genAI may be considered as dishonest or unfair behaviour, and therefore a breach of academic integrity. If your Unit Coordinator thinks you have used a genAI tool inappropriately, you may be asked to complete a Confirmation of Learning Check.

app_answers_detail_a_id_2547,What is a major?,"A major is an area of focus in your degree. During your studies, you'll choose an area that interests you, and then study a group of units related to that area. For example, you might study a Bachelor of Arts majoring in Media and Communication. You would then study eight Media and Communications units, each worth 12. 5 credit points. You'll find more information about available majors on your course page. How many units are in a major? Majors are usually worth 100 credit points, equivalent to eight units at 12. 5 credit points. All majors include: 25 credit points at the introductory level (Level 100) 25 credit points at the intermediate level (Level 200) 50 credit points at the advanced level (Level 300) In some courses, you can complete a second major in your elective space. Find out more about elective units. How do I choose a major? When you're thinking about which major to choose, consider the following: If you're not sure what you want to do, don't worry. Find your course information in the Course and Unit Handbook, and see what options are available for your course. You can also contact our friendly UConnect staff, or make an appointment with a Student Adviser if you need help planning your studies. If you're still having trouble deciding, try picking two or three areas and taking the first-year units in each. This will give you more options at the end of your first year. Instead of majors, some courses are made up entirely of core units. These are units that need to be completed during your studies. Other courses refer to areas of study as specialisations rather than majors. It is possible to change your major, however it depends on whether your course allows for changes of major or specialisation, how far you are through your course, and the potential impact on the time it would take for you to complete your course. To discuss your options, contact UConnect to get in touch with your Student Advisers. If you are starting your course, you may be able to plan for and take a second major via your 'Discipline Electives' or your 'Electives'. From 2023, many bachelor's degrees students will be able to add the sustainability major to the study plan. You can do this in eStudent. Our double degrees allow you to deepen your knowledge and expertise within two separate study areas. You’ll complete two degrees in a shorter time than studying them both separately. If you’re studying a double degree, you’ll complete the major requirements for both courses. Learn more about our double degrees.",app_answers_detail_a_id_2547.html

A valid USI must be provided by the census date of your first study period to avoid cancellation of your enrolment. Students who were studying when the USI requirement came into effect, will also need to provide a valid USI to avoid cancellation of their enrolment. Not providing a valid USI can also result in not being able to view you results or graduate. Your USI is unique to you – you only need to create it once and you have the number for life. Before you get started, make sure you have handy a form of identification that you can enter (e. g. a driver’s license or passport). The process is online and takes about 5 minutes: Go to the Unique Student Identifier site, click on 'Create a USI' and then 'Get Started' Before you’re provided with your USI, you’ll be asked to: Provide your details and evidence of identity Create a password for the USI portal Provide your details and evidence of identity Create a password for the USI portal Provide your details and evidence of identity Create a password for the USI portal Include your USI when you complete your Commonwealth Assistance Form in eStudent, or Under 'My Forms' in eStudent, select the 'Enter / Update Unique Student Identifier (USI)' form If you will be taking all of your study outside of Australia, you do not need a USI.

The USI Student Portal has upgraded its security features to help protect your identity. You may now experience: Multi-factor authentication (MFA): You’ll receive a one-time code via your personal mobile or email when you create, activate, or log in to your USI account. If you don’t have access to a personal mobile or email, you’ll need to answer two security questions. Passwords now need to be a minimum of 15 characters.
